Mah Jongg Scorekeeper Script
============================

A simple tool written in Python 3 to keep score in a Mah Jongg game.

The main purpose of this project is to learn and improve Python skills. All hints and tips accepted though I am trying to fall over and get back up rather than have a flawless program straight away. 

Tips on conventions and best practices (being more Pythonic, I guess) particularly welcome.

Thanks

===STAGE 1===
Input the 4 scores and calculate the chip transactions.
It works but is ugly as hell.

TODO:
Massive tidy up (Better Maths).
